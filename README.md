**About Me**

Hello Everyone,

I’m Divakar Kohli, and with over 21 years of IT experience, 7 to 8 of which have been focused on Data Analysis and Power BI. I am passionate about helping the Power BI User Community grow and excel in their skills.
I offer training and support in Data Analysis, Power BI, SQL Server, SSAS, SSRS, SSIS (including Azure Data Factory). If you’re interested in learning or improving in any of these areas, feel free to reach out.
I’m primarily student and employee-oriented and tend to avoid consultancy work unless there’s a critical issue that needs urgent attention. 
I believe in proving my calibre through work rather than words, and I hope to build strong, supportive partnerships along the way.

I’ve recently started engaging with queries related to the Fabric Community on GitHub and will be sharing Power BI files and related Excel datasets to help you learn and practice.

A partner who supports and stands by you.

Regards,<br/>
